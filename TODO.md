# TODO for Traditional East Javanese Game Recommender UI

- [x] Update index.html: Add header with title, form for filters (location dropdown, min/max player inputs), and a results div to display games.
- [x] Update css/style.css: Define CSS variables for the colors, style the page with a clean layout, buttons, and cards for games.
- [x] Update js/script.js: Add mock data array for games (e.g., 5-10 traditional East Javanese games with name, description, min/max players, location), functions to filter and render results.
- [x] Test the website by opening index.html in a browser to verify UX.
- [x] Add hover effects to game cards and buttons in CSS.
- [x] Add "how to play" data to games, implement modal popup on game card click with instructions and images.
- [x] Add admin panel for adding new games: form with inputs, submit to add to array and re-render.
- [x] Update HTML for modal and admin panel toggle.
- [x] Test new features: hover, modal, admin panel.
- [x] Update image sources to local 'images' folder for better loading and offline use.
